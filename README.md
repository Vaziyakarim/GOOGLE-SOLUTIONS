EcoBin ‚Äì AI-Powered E-Waste Management System


About the Project
Electronic waste (e-waste) is a growing environmental crisis, with millions of discarded devices contributing to pollution, toxic waste, and resource loss. Many people lack awareness of proper disposal methods, and existing recycling processes are inefficient and unregulated.

EcoBin is an AI-powered e-waste management system that simplifies recycling by integrating smart bins, AI-based waste classification, and blockchain tracking. It enables users to scan e-waste, locate smart bins, schedule pickups, track recycling progress, and earn rewards for responsible disposal.

Our solution leverages AI, IoT, and blockchain to make e-waste recycling efficient, transparent, and rewarding, ensuring proper disposal and minimal environmental impact.

AI-Generated App
The EcoBin app was created using AI-powered app builders, allowing users to scan e-waste, find disposal centers, and schedule pickups seamlessly.
